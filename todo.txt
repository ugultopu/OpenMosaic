- Convert "science_birds_level_constructor" to a Python class.
- You use "tile" and "block" to refer to the same thing. Unify these.

DONE
----
- Right now, the "point" for the platforms (that is, the tile that we take as
reference of the beginning of the platform) is top-left. However, in order to
make it consistent with the matrix (that is, list of lists) that contain the
tiles of the mosaic, making it bottom-left and make it extend towards above and
right makes more sense.
- If a platform extends too above, such that it goes over the ceiling of the
structure, simply insert the required blocks to complete the platform.
- To fix the instability problem, your best bet seems to be to hold a variable
to remember the X distance from the origin as well. Implement this.
- Shorten the highly explicit variable names and instead add a comment to the
place that they have been defined in order to describe their purpose.
